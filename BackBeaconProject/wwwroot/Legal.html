However, Your Travel Agency is not responsible for errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to price, product or service descriptions or to availability due to the transfer of Suppliers’ information from third parties, or due to technical or human error.

Your Travel Agency is not responsible for any action, inaction, breach of contract, error or omission on the part of the Suppliers relating to a booking that you decide to make and which results in any loss, damage, delay, inconvenience, injury or death to you or your travel companions, whether resulting from, but not limited to, acts of God or force majeure, illness, disease, acts of war or civil unrest, insurrection or revolt, animals, strikes or other labor activities, criminal or terrorist activities of any kind, overbooking or downgrading of accommodations or services, mechanical or other failure of airplanes, ships or other means of transportation, or for any failure of any transportation mechanism to arrive or depart on time. You understand that your legal recourse is against the specific Supplier not Your Travel Agency. Also be advised that certain foreign facilities such as air-conditioning systems in public places, air craft, hotels and motor coaches may not be up to U.S. standards. If due to weather, flight schedules or other uncontrollable factors you are required to spend additional night(s), you will be responsible for your own hotel, transfers and meal costs. Baggage is entirely at the owner’s risk.

                                All passengers must have a valid passport when boarding the ship, even if your cruise includes only domestic destinations. If your cruise is an international sailing, the countries you visit will also require proof of citizenship. We strongly recommend bringing a valid passport as this is the only form of identification accepted by most countries. International travel by US citizens requires a US passport that is valid for at least 6 months beyond the return travel date.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, some countries require Travel Visas. You will need both a travel visa and a passport if your cruise departs from or visits a port of call that requires a visa. You are responsible for acquiring the necessary visas. Travel Visa applications and approvals can take significant time to process so you should apply for your travel visa as soon as possible. If your cruise departs from or visits a port of call that requires a visa you must have a valid passport for your trip. Contact your consulate for specific requirements. Any fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is your responsibility to check all required documents as requirements are subject to change and differ for various itineraries. To learn about visa requirements, or to purchase a passport or visa, visit the CIBT Web site at http://www.us.cibt.com/ for US citizens, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada website at http://www.voyage.gc.ca/ for Canadian citizens, or your local consulate for non US or Canadian citizens.

                                All passengers in your cruise cabin must be 6 months or older, however the minimum age may be 12 months on select sailings.

                                Certain cruise lines require that passengers younger than 21 years old be accompanied by an adult 21 or older in the same cabin. You may need to show proof of age when boarding the ship. For more information on traveling with children please see the cruise line’s general conditions, rules and regulations for details.

                                If you are traveling with a child younger than 21 and both parents are not traveling, the cruise line may require you to provide a notarized letter from their children permission to travel. Additionally, many countries have their own requirements for children traveling without parents.

                                All reference to aircraft departure times set out in this Travel Record are for your guidance and are subject by amendment by the Suppliers prior to actual booking. It isn't until full payment has been made and your itinerary has been ticketed that price and availability of flights are confirmed. You must check your itinerary at each stage of the completion of the booking with the Supplier(s) to ensure that you have the correct flight times and dates. It is possible that changes to flight times will occur even after tickets have been issued; in such cases you will be advised of such changes prior to departure directly by the airline or by Your Travel Agency.

                                All airline tickets must be issued in the name of the passport/photo identity holder. An incorrect name on a booking may result in an inability to use that booking and the booking being cancelled at the traveler’s expense. Any errors in names, dates and timings may result in an inability to use that booking and the booking being cancelled. Any errors in names, dates and timings on your documentation will be your responsibility if not advised at the time of booking.

                                Airlines may charge additional fees for checked baggage, advanced seat selection, or other optional services. Changes requested by you after ticketing will also result in airline imposed service fees as well as possible airfare increases. These fees and any associated taxes will be passed on to you. Changes subject to fees and associated taxes may include without limitation, changes in carrier(s) flight(s), time(s) or routing(s). Most discount and promotional air fares involve certain restrictions; for instance, a change in carrier(s) flight(s), time(s) or routing(s) may result in an air carrier demanding a full fare. Please read the complete penalty rules for changes and cancellations applicable to this fare by visiting the website of the airline Supplier identified under the ‘Flight Details’ section above. You may wish to obtain agency or airline Supplier assistance before making changes. Additional charges may apply.

Travel documents will be issued once appropriate payment is made (as noted above). In addition to airline travel documents, other travel documents may also be subject to certain conditions and/or restrictions such as, but not limited to, being nonrefundable, non-date-changeable, and subject to cancellation and/or amendment fees.

                                For air travel, all passengers are asked to check-in at least 2 hours for domestic and 3 hours for international prior to the scheduled time of departure of their flight due to enhanced security measures. We also recommend on-line check-in that is available with most airlines at least 12 hours prior to departure. All travelers must be present with their boarding documents, government issued identification, passports and visas necessary for the destination. Any passenger arriving late for check-in will be denied boarding. It is your responsibility to verify check-in times with your air carrier Supplier by visiting your air carrier Supplier’s website or contacting the air carrier Supplier 24 hours prior to your flight.
                            </p>

                                Your Travel Agency recommends that you reconfirm the use and time of flights at least 24 hours for domestic and 72 hours for international. Some airlines will have schedule changes and your flight time may differ to what is stated on your Itinerary. We are not responsible for schedule changes. Failure to use any reservations may result in automatic cancellation of all continuing and return reservations. Most discount fares involve certain restrictions. If you intend to cancel your reservation, please cancel your reservation prior to flight time or air ticket will have no value.

                                It is your responsibility to ensure you are aware of any health requirements for your travel destinations and to ensure that you carry all necessary vaccination documentation. Please advise your travel consultant of any special requirements you may have, for example, special meals, medical requirements and so on.

                                Some countries require insecticide spraying of aircraft prior to a flight or while you are on the aircraft. Please see the Department of Transport disinfection website for more information.

                                Suppliers typically reserve the right to refuse service to travelers at their sole discretion and including without limitation if the traveler: lacks proper documentation for the country of destination; has a contagious disease; is under the influence of alcohol, drugs or narcotics; and/or manifests disruptive and/or unruly behavior. Your Travel Agency assumes no liability for the acts of the Suppliers in refusing service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Be prepared to present a government issued photo identification at the airline Supplier’s ticket counter. For international flights, a government issued passport that is valid for at least 6 months beyond the return travel date is typically required. Additionally, some countries require Travel Visas. You will need both a Travel Visa and a passport if your aircraft departs from or arrives at a destination that requires a visa. You are responsible for confirming with the representative government agency of the country to which you are traveling, the requirements for and for obtaining visas and/or other requirements for admission to your destination. Travel Visa applications and approvals can take significant time to process so you should apply for your Travel Visa as soon as possible. If your aircraft departs from or arrives at a destination that requires a Travel Visa you must have a valid passport for your trip. Contact your consulate for specific requirements. Immigration authorities have the sole discretion to deny entry even when the relevant documentation is provided. A traveler with criminal history may be denied entry. Any fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have valid travel documentation, including but not limited to passports and visas, which meet the requirements of immigration and other government authorities at every destination.

                                Whether travelling alone or accompanied by an adult, each child must travel with his/her own travel documents, a passport and appropriate visa, plus supporting documentation: i.e. birth certificate showing the names of both parents and/or legal documents pertaining to custody.
                            </p>

                                An adult travelling with minor children is strongly advised to hold a notarized letter of travel consent signed by other parent(s) or guardian(s) with legal custody. The letter must include the signor's address, phone details, and authorization to travel, the destination and length of stay. If a parent/guardian is divorced or deceased, a custody document or death certificate is required. For unaccompanied minors travelling, details of the person who is responsible for meeting the minor at the destination will also be required. It is your responsibility to obtain all documents including those for infants and children required by relevant government authorities of the country you're visiting.

                                Many countries have their own requirements for children traveling without parents.

For more information visit the CIBT Web site at http://www.us.cibt.com/ for US citizens, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada website at http://www.voyage.gc.ca/ for Canadian citizens, or your local consulate for non US or Canadian citizens.

                                If an airline declares bankruptcy, it is not obligated to carry you or to refund tickets issued before the bankruptcy. Travel agents are not allowed to refund tickets on airlines which have declared bankruptcy. Money given to a travel agent immediately becomes property of the airlines. If an airline declares bankruptcy, it might continue service, limit service, or stop completely. Other airlines might accept passengers under limited circumstances or may refuse to accept any passengers from the defaulted carrier. There are travel insurance plans available for passengers to protect themselves in case of airline bankruptcies. Please contact Your Travel Agency for more details.

Further, trip insurance or waivers provided by the Supplier may not provide insolvency coverage.
